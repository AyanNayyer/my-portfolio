        <p>I've started questioning things.</p>
        <p>Why does anything matter? For that matter, why do the petals of cherry blossoms fall at the rate of 5 centimeters per second and not 10? Does it all end up adding to the little things in the end?</p>
        <p>Everything we do is supposed to affect something in the larger picture, like a series of dominos. But why is it that something you'vIe been longing for, for so long, isn't left for destiny to decide? Why do you have to care and shape it into what you want it to be?</p>
        <p>Just as the cherry blossom will eventually fall, I wonder if our efforts to control outcomes are futile. Is there a predetermined path, or is everything we do a small yet significant part of a greater mosaic?</p>
        <p>I've started questioning things.!</p>`

        <p>Sitting along the library's passage,

drawing and erasing boundaries around her,

lost in her own thoughts, she turned toward me,

her ink-stained hands reaching out,

her bright eyes locking with mine.

The time’s pulse began to fade,

as the sorrow of reading a message within her gaze consumed me.

And just as I was lost in that moment,

came the command to knot the loose threads of life’s sleeves.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t. I couldn’t let go of the moment.</p>
<p>And so, I stayed.</p>
        <p>And so, I remained.</p>

        <p>I don't love anyone, I don't like anyone but,

I do 'live' some people.

Live? Haha, Looks like a newbie.

Take 'Li' from like and 've' from love.</p>
<p>It doesn't require confessing your feelings to yourself, unlike 'like'. It also doesn't require trusting someone blindly, unlike 'love'. what it does require is a wholesome indulgence of yourself. 


You live somebody,You are now experiencing what he/she does. Be it sorrow, Be it happiness, be it pain, be it joy. You take it together, You live it together.

</p>
<p>"live' isn't something as shallow as like it's neither as deep as 'love'. It's something which binds two life in one.</p>`
